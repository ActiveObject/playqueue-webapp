# PlayQueue
Audio player for [vk.com](http://vk.com) social network with play queue and news aggregator.

This app is not production-ready at current time. It is just an attempt to make the world's best single page application.

In the wild (only for users who have vk.com account): <http://app.playqueue.com>. App has been deployed to Heroku platform with free account so first page access might be slow.
